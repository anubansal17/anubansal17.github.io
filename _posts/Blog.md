> Like everyone else, I too had a lot of fantasies for my first job. No matter what, your first job is always special to you -That first time traveling in local buses, having tea breaks -lunch breaks with your colleagues, and most importantly that the first salary ;) It’s all exciting, isn’t it?
> 
> And if I would talk about my experience so far, so it has been a roller coaster ride for me. I had been into tech since my college days and worked like I am my own master always. But all of this soon vanished away, the day I entered the _Corporate World_. Now, you get much less time for yourself and for doing all those courses that always excited you but I would say here, management is the key and I am still trying to master it :P

**_First 2 months of internship_**

> At the very start, I had gone through a 2 weeks training program with 3 other placed students from my college and then after that, we hit the floor with all the product knowledge that we have gained in the training program.

Meanwhile, I participated in the games organized by the company and also won some amazing gifts🎁</br>

> Thereafter, the company had put us in QA for around 2 weeks and it was all shocking for me. I was like, What the heck! Why would a developer need to do QA? I was all disturbed during that time, but soon I realized its importance in one’s work. Indeed, a developer can never be a great developer until he gains good product knowledge!
> 
> Finally, the D Day came and we have been assigned our Dev teams. And luckily, my team leader turns out to be my college alumni. So, things became comfortable working with him and seeking guidance from him. In the initial 1 month, I was working on small dev tasks which lasts for at most 1 week.
> 
> And here, I marked the 2 months of my internship💪🏻

**_Next remaining months of internship_**

> These months started with my first break from the office because of the Holi-days. It was all refreshing but we never knew that we won’t be joining the office in-person after 2 days. Yes, you guessed it right…The lockdown happened and we all started working from home. The most interesting thing was the project that I was assigned at the beginning of it, the most challenging project that I have ever worked on!
> 
> I named the project \*Pro Code Coverage\*, as it’s a Pro in helping your testing team to improve your production sized code coverage. Too much confusion, isn’t it? Okay, lemme explain😎
> 
> The project was based on finding the APIs for all the untested methods in the code used at production. But, it was not that simple as it seems. Here I needed to find the extreme callers for all the untested methods and then needed to check if the API for the same exists or not. If it exists, then it should be escalated to the testing team that the given method can be called by this API and if it doesn’t exist, it should be escalated to the dev team to mark the method as deprecated. So, the crux of the project was based on finding all the callers of the method and the callers of the callers and the process continue till we find the API or we aren’t done with all the callers. A lot of R&D work has been done to figure out the way to do the same but it was all worth the efforts🔥
> 
> I worked on the project all by myself and still tries to refactor it whenever I get time from the assigned tasks. I am the owner of this project. Isn’t it amazing? You joined an organization just a few months back and you are making an impact in a positive way✨
> 
> I am also planning to write a new blog describing the project end to end, just to make it less challenging for you to improve the coverage of your production code in a developer style😎
